# Anchor-vector-Class-Balanced-Graph-Convolutional-Network-for-class-imbalance
Pytorch implementation of A New Graph-based Method for Class Imbalance in Surface Defect Classification, which is under review in IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation & Measurement.
### Requirements
You will need the following to run the above:
- Pytorch 1.0.1, Torchvision 0.4.1
- Python 3.6.8, Pillow 5.4.1, scikit-learn 0.21.1, numpy 1.16.2
- If you want to train (and don't want to wait for 4 months):
  - A decent GPU
  - All the required NVIDIA software to run TF on a GPU (cuda, etc)
### Dataset
4 benchmark datasets are used to evaluate the proposed method, NEU-CLS-64, wood dataset, textile dataset and GC10
- NEU-CLS-64:You can access [here](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/yunhyan/NEU_surface_defect_database.html) and download NEU-CLS-64, and put the dataset in directory 'NEU-CLS-64'.
- wood dataset: You can access [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00138-002-0084-z) to download the dataset and put it in directory 'wood'.
- textile dataset: You can access [here](https://www.kaggle.com/belkhirnacim/textiledefectdetection) to download the dataset and put it in directory 'textile'.
- GC10: You can access [this paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/6/1562) to download the dataset and put it in directory 'MSD'.
